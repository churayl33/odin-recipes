            <ol>
                <li>
                    It is best to soak wooden skewers in water whilst prepping the chicken. Cut them to the size of the pan or tray you are cooking them in.  
                </li>
                <li>
                    In a bowl or food bag, mix together yoghurt, tandoori masala, garlic and the juice of ½ a lemon.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Add cubed chicken breast and stir to coat. For best results leave to marinate for 2 hours in the fridge.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Thread the chicken onto the kebab sticks you should have between 4-6 sticks worth of chicken
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>PAN/GRIDDLE:</b> Spray the pan with spray oil and bring to medium heat, cook for about 20 minutes (10 minutes on each side, turning only once)
