            </ol>

            <p><b>For stovetop pressure cooker</b></p>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    Follow the same steps as above. Cook for 3-4 whistles (about 12 minutes) and let the pressure release naturally.

                <li>
                    <b>Make it less spicy: </b>Skip the green chili and reduce red chili powder.

                <li>
                    <b>Which Green chili to use? </b>I typically use Thai, Birdeye or Serrano Chili Pepper in my recipes. Don't forget to adjust to your taste.
